# Changelog

Versioning: `x.y`, `x` fixed at `0` while the app is in development — see
the README's **Versioning** section for the exact rule (only the project
owner bumps `x`; everything below is a `0.y` development build, not a
release).

## v0.8 — 2026-09-03

Content/dev coordination lands, plus a small feature that closes the loop
on Profil's weak-spot data.

- **`docs/education-notes.md`** brought in from the content-authoring
  side's coordination branch: curriculum order for the next 12 topics, and
  a proposed interaction model for Eğitim (a linear, chapter-by-chapter
  guided path, soft-unlocked) versus Test (staying fully open, unchanged).
  Responded on the dev side: approved the proposal and its one new
  optional lesson field (`intro`), and decided embedded chapter-check
  questions share the same pool as Test rather than needing a reserved
  subset — full reasoning in the file.
- **New: "Pratik Yap" on weak categories.** Profil's weak-category list
  now has a button per entry that launches an open, category-scoped Test
  session straight from that weak spot, instead of just showing the
  number. `quiz.js` gained an optional `category` filter on top of its
  existing topic/count request shape to support this — no new schema,
  no content dependency.
- Weak-topic/weak-category list rows now share a `.breakdown-list__info`
  wrapper (small internal refactor to make room for the action button
  without duplicating the row-layout CSS).

## v0.7 — 2026-09-03

Small follow-ups from the `v0.6` navigation pass — closing out the last
two items planned for this round.

- **Dismissible "still in development" note**: a small banner above the
  tabs tells first-time visitors the app isn't `v1` yet and what's
  usable today (Eğitim, Test, Profil). Dismissing it is remembered
  locally and survives a history reset — it's a separate, deliberately
  simpler stand-in for the more elaborate multi-step onboarding tour
  that was on the roadmap; that fuller tour is deferred as
  disproportionate for this stage.
- **Weak-spot lists show rank numbers** ("1. Tenses", "2. ..."):
  addresses artifact-comment feedback that the ordering read as
  arbitrary — entries were already sorted weakest-first, the numbers
  just make that order visible instead of implicit.
- Ported both to the "Tenses Practice" artifact.

## v0.6 — 2026-09-03

Navigation restructure, driven directly by artifact-comment feedback left
on the `v0.5` preview — the recurring point across several comments was
that Profil didn't belong next to Eğitim/Test.

- **Profil moved out of the tab bar.** It now opens from a small circular
  button in the header instead of sitting as a third tab — it's
  identity/settings, not a content mode, so grouping it with Eğitim/Test
  was structurally wrong. The tab bar is back to two tabs.
- **Personalized header greeting.** Once a display name is set in Profil,
  the header shows "Hoş geldin, {name}!" instead of the static tagline,
  and the profile button shows the learner's initial. Updates live, no
  reload needed.
- **Header simplified**: the visible app name is now just "English Prep".
- Removed the artifact-only "Anlık önizleme" preview badge from its
  header, per direct feedback that it wasn't needed.
- This is the first step of a broader UX pass; see README's **Roadmap to
  v1.0** for what's next (a short onboarding tour, and a guided learning
  path mechanism in Eğitim).

## v0.5 — 2026-09-02

New "Profil" tab — a real, visible local profile, replacing the previous
silent/nameless tracking as the home for anything about *you* rather than
about a specific test result.

- **New "Profil" tab**: third tab alongside Eğitim/Test. Shows an optional
  display name (local only, saved on this device, never sent anywhere),
  overall stats (tests completed, questions answered, overall accuracy),
  and — once enough data exists — which topics and which grammar
  categories you're weakest in.
- **Per-category weak-spot history now persists**: category results were
  already shown per-test on the results screen, but weren't saved across
  sessions. `recordAttempt()` now persists `categoryBreakdown` alongside
  the existing per-topic breakdown, so "Zayıf Olduğun Kategoriler" reflects
  real history, not just the last test.
- **"Clear history" moved into Profil**: the old header button is gone;
  resetting local history (same in-app confirmation modal as before) now
  lives under Profil's "Ayarlar" section.
- Content-freshness tracking (the "Yeni sorular eklendi" badge) is
  unchanged and stays separate from the new profile — it isn't cleared by
  the history reset.
- Resolved the open design question on the quiz category eyebrow label:
  kept, since it's the same taxonomy the Eğitim tab's lessons use, not
  just decoration.

## v0.4 — 2026-09-02

Structural UX overhaul, driven by direct feedback on the v0.3 build and
preview artifact.

- **App shell rewrite**: the app is now a fixed-height column (header/tabs,
  a scrolling content area, a fixed bottom action bar on quiz/results)
  instead of an ordinary scrolling page. Answering a question no longer
  pushes the "Next Question" button around, and no screen ever shifts
  horizontally (no visible scrollbar anywhere, hidden via CSS while
  staying scrollable).
- **New "Eğitim" (teaching) mode**: a segmented Eğitim/Test tab control on
  the home screen. Eğitim is a fast, paginated tour through each topic's
  categories — a short rule plus simple examples, no scoring. Ships with 6
  real lessons for Tenses.
- **Custom in-app components replace native browser chrome**: the
  question-count picker is now an app-owned dropdown instead of `<select>`;
  "Clear history" now opens an in-app confirmation modal instead of
  `window.confirm()`. Neither can trigger OS-native UI or reflow the page.
- **Silent content-freshness tracking**: a nameless local record (extending
  the existing score history, no login, no visible profile screen) tracks
  which `contentVersion` of a topic a learner has seen, showing a "Yeni
  sorular eklendi" badge when it's grown since their last visit.
- **Full Turkish UI copy pass**: every interface string (buttons, headings,
  status lines, empty states) is now in Turkish. Practice sentences stay
  English; explanations/tips stay Turkish (already were); grammar category
  labels stay English.
- De-emphasized the `____` blank styling and removed the visible
  keyboard-shortcut hint (the 1–4/Enter shortcuts still work, just aren't
  advertised) per direct feedback that both were too loud for the primary
  mobile audience.

## v0.3 — 2026-09-02

UI/UX polish pass, informed by the roadmap (more topics, more tiers).

- Fixed a box-width inconsistency: the topic grid used `auto-fill` (which
  reserves empty grid tracks) and its padding wasn't scoped to a bordered
  container, so topic cards floated narrower than the hero panel with
  unexplained dead space. Switched to `auto-fit` and moved the grid's
  padding onto `.topic-tier`, so panels at the same nesting level always
  match widths.
- Quiz screen: added a "Back to Home" exit link, an animated progress bar,
  and a visible keyboard-shortcut hint (the 1-4/Enter shortcuts already
  worked but were undiscoverable).
- Topic cards now show a category-preview chip row.
- Added a real "Modals" (Core Grammar tier) `comingSoon` manifest entry, so
  the tier accordion groups topics for real today instead of only in a
  temporary test edit — rendered as a disabled "Coming soon" card, excluded
  from the mixed-test question pool.

## v0.2 — 2026-09-02

Content and visual identity overhaul, replacing v0.1's placeholder content
and generic look before any real use.

- **Tenses content rewritten**: replaced the 16 isolated, single-sentence
  placeholder questions with 24 paragraph-based cloze questions grouped
  into 6 confusable-form categories (e.g. "Present Perfect vs Past
  Simple"), matching the actual difficulty of a YTÜ İYS-style Cloze Test.
  Explanations and tips are now written in Turkish, the learner's own
  language; practice sentences stay in English.
- **New `tip` field**: each question now carries a short, generalizable
  rule alongside its situational explanation — shown in the quiz feedback
  and in the results review.
- **Category breakdown**: the results screen now shows a per-category score
  breakdown (in addition to per-topic), so a learner can see, e.g., that
  they specifically struggle with Past Perfect vs Past Simple.
- **Visual identity redesigned**: replaced the generic light "card + shadow"
  look with a single deliberate dark theme — warm ink-and-amber palette,
  Fraunces display serif for headings, IBM Plex Sans/Mono for body and
  numbers, hairline borders instead of shadowed cards.
- Manifest simplified to a single "Tenses" topic (was two separate,
  thinner per-tense topics).

## v0.1 — 2026-09-02

Initial development build.

- Home, quiz, and results screens for multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank
  practice questions.
- Mixed test (random questions across all topics) and per-topic test modes.
- Immediate answer feedback with full teaching explanations.
- Results screen with score, per-topic breakdown, and a weak-topic callout
  based on locally saved history (`localStorage`, no backend).
- First topic set: Present Simple and Past Simple (8 questions each).
- Fully static, no build step; deploys directly via GitHub Pages.
